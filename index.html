                    <div id="about-me-content" class="section-content">
                        <p>Since childhood, I've been fascinated by computers. My father, a computer engineer, would configure routers and switches remotely, and while I didn't fully understand his work, I was captivated by the console prompts where all the magic happened. Growing up, I spent a lot of time in front of computers, mainly playing video games. In high school, I discovered my passion for math and problem-solving.</p>
                        <p>During my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, nothing felt better than writing a piece of code that worked. It was then that I became familiar with machine learning, a turning point in my journey. I realized that my love for linear algebra and calculus could be combined with programming to create astonishing results, sparking my passion for AI.</p>
                        <p>I pursued my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Calgary, where I delved into computer graphics and visualization. These fields excite me because I enjoy making complex topics tangible and understandable, and visualization is a powerful tool for that. My project, which involved machine learning, focused on improving volume visualization across different fields, yielding exciting results.</p>
                        <p>Today, I have an insatiable thirst for learning and am eager to take on new projects that can positively impact the world. I am enthusiastic about applying my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that drive progress and make a difference.</p>
